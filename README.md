# LTE-Bufferbloat-Fix
This project documents the implementation of Smart Queue Management (SQM) using the CAKE discipline on a GL-AX1800 (Flint) router running a mobile LTE backhaul. The goal was to reduce network latency (bufferbloat) from a Grade D/F to a stable Grade C+ in a high-jitter cellular environment.
