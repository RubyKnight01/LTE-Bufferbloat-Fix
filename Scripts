📜 Automation & Configuration Scripts

These scripts handle the initialization of the virtual bridge, persistence across reboots, and the disabling of hardware acceleration.


1. SQM Initialization Script

File Path: /etc/init.d/sqm-fix

Purpose: Handles the creation of the virtual bridge and links WAN traffic to the CPU shaper.
Bash

#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common

# This script creates a virtual IFB device for Ingress (Download) shaping
# and redirects eth0 traffic to it so SQM/CAKE can process it.

START=99

start() {
    echo "Initializing SQM Bridge for Qualcomm NSS bypass..."

    # 1. Create the virtual device using the SQM naming convention
    ip link add name ifb4eth0 type ifb 2>/dev/null
    ip link set dev ifb4eth0 up
    
    # 2. Attach the Ingress Qdisc hook to the physical WAN port (eth0)
    tc qdisc add dev eth0 handle ffff: ingress 2>/dev/null
    
    # 3. Redirect all traffic from eth0 to the virtual device ifb4eth0
    tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: protocol all u32 match u32 0 0 \
    action mirred egress redirect dev ifb4eth0 2>/dev/null
    
    # 4. Restart the SQM service to pick up the new interface
    /etc/init.d/sqm restart
    
    echo "SQM Bridge successfully linked to ifb4eth0."
}

stop() {
    echo "Tearing down SQM Bridge..."
    ip link delete ifb4eth0 2>/dev/null
}





2. Hotplug Persistence Script

File Path: /etc/hotplug.d/iface/99-sqm-fix

Purpose: Ensures the fix is "event-driven"—re-applying the bridge whenever the LTE connection cycles or the WAN interface comes online.
Bash

#!/bin/sh

# Hotplug script to ensure SQM persists after interface resets.
# Triggered when the WAN interface (eth0) comes online.

[ "$ACTION" = "ifup" ] && [ "$INTERFACE" = "wan" ] && /etc/init.d/sqm-fix start




3. Hardware Acceleration Kill-Switch

Execution: Run via CLI

Purpose: Disables the Qualcomm NSS and Shortcut Forwarding Engine (SFE) to prevent packets from bypassing the CPU shaper.
Bash

#!/bin/sh

# Disable NSS and Firewall Offloading
uci set network.globals.nss_offload='0' 2>/dev/null
uci set firewall.@defaults[0].flow_offloading='0'
uci set firewall.@defaults[0].fullcone_nat='0'

# Commit changes
uci commit network
uci commit firewall

# Restart services to apply CPU-path routing
/etc/init.d/network restart
/etc/init.d/firewall restart

# Disable the proprietary Shortcut Forwarding Engine if present
/etc/init.d/shortcut-fe stop
/etc/init.d/shortcut-fe disable
